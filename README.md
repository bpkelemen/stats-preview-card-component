## My process

I added another breakpoint for tablet view. So, the original mobile view starts under 420px. Tablet view is betweem 420px and 1100px. Desktop view is over 1100px.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS

### What I learned

After spending hundreds of hours watching tutorials, it turns out that very simple and easy things can be tricky when you actually have to code it.
